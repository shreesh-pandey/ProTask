🧠 Core Components
index.html

The main HTML page that contains the structure and layout of the app.

It imports necessary CSS and JavaScript files for styling and functionality.

style.css

Contains global styles that define the look and feel of the app.

Includes responsive design principles for a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

script.js

Contains the primary logic of the app, including:

Pomodoro timer functionality (start, pause, reset)

Task management (add, edit, delete, mark as complete)

Notifications and reminders

Day-end summary and productivity tracking

Interacts with the DOM to dynamically update the UI based on user input.

🔄 App Flow
User Interaction:

Users interact with the web page through buttons and input fields.

Tasks are added and assigned priorities.

Pomodoro sessions are started through the UI, triggering timers and automatic breaks.

Timer Logic:

The Pomodoro timer runs using JavaScript's setInterval() function to keep track of the work and break periods.

After completing a cycle of work and break, the user is notified to start a new Pomodoro or take a longer break.

Task Progression:

Each task’s progress is tracked in real time.

Users can mark tasks as completed, which updates the task list.

End-of-Day Summary:

At the end of the day, the app summarizes the user’s progress, displaying:

Total number of Pomodoros completed

Tasks completed

Total time spent working

⚙️ Future Architecture Considerations
Backend Integration: As the app grows, future versions may involve saving task data to a backend server (e.g., Node.js + MongoDB or Firebase).

Multi-Device Sync: User data may be synchronized across devices for better usability.

Cross-platform Support: Consider making the app available on mobile and desktop via frameworks like Electron.
